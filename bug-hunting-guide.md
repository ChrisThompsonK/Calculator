# Calculator Bug Hunting Workshop - Student Guide

## Overview
Welcome to the Calculator Bug Hunting Workshop! This calculator application contains intentional bugs that you'll need to discover and analyze using systematic debugging techniques.

## Bug Categories and Learning Objectives

### üî¥ **Logic Errors** (High Priority)
**Learning Focus**: Understanding application flow, operator precedence, data types

### üü° **UI/UX Issues** (Medium Priority)  
**Learning Focus**: User experience, visual debugging, CSS properties

### üü† **JavaScript Errors** (High Priority)
**Learning Focus**: Type coercion, syntax errors, scope issues

### üîµ **Data Validation** (Medium Priority)
**Learning Focus**: Input validation, edge cases, error handling

### üü£ **Performance/Design** (Low Priority)
**Learning Focus**: Responsive design, CSS specificity

## üéØ Debugging Methodology

### **Phase 1: Systematic Testing** 
Start by testing each feature of the calculator methodically:

#### Basic Operations
- Test all arithmetic operations (+, -, √ó, √∑)
- Try various number combinations
- Check keyboard vs mouse input consistency

#### Advanced Features
- Test memory functions (MS, MR, M+, M-, MC)
- Try percentage calculations
- Test square root and square operations
- Verify decimal point functionality

#### Edge Cases
- Very large numbers
- Very small numbers
- Division by zero scenarios
- Multiple decimal points

#### User Interface
- Visual appearance and alignment
- Button hover effects
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- History panel functionality

### **Phase 2: Investigation Techniques**

When you find unexpected behavior:

1. **Reproduce Consistently**: Can you make it happen again?
2. **Isolate the Issue**: What specific action triggers it?
3. **Compare Expected vs Actual**: What should happen vs what does happen?
4. **Use Developer Tools**: Inspect the code and console for clues

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools and Techniques

### **Browser Developer Tools**
- **Console Tab**: Look for JavaScript errors and warnings
- **Elements Tab**: Inspect HTML structure and CSS styles
- **Application Tab**: Check localStorage and session data
- **Network Tab**: Monitor resource loading issues

### **Testing Strategies**
1. **Functional Testing**: Test each feature systematically
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Try boundary conditions and extreme values
3. **Input Validation**: Test invalid or unexpected inputs
4. **Cross-Feature Testing**: Test how features interact with each other
5. **Visual Inspection**: Compare with expected calculator behavior

### **Common Bug Patterns to Look For**

#### Logic Issues
- Operations producing wrong results
- Functions behaving differently than labeled
- Calculations not following proper order of operations

#### Input Handling
- Keyboard shortcuts not working as expected
- Mouse clicks behaving differently than keyboard input
- Invalid input being accepted when it shouldn't be

#### Display Problems
- Numbers not appearing correctly
- Visual elements not updating when they should
- Alignment or formatting issues

#### Data Persistence
- Settings or history not saving properly
- Information being lost when it shouldn't be
- Data appearing in unexpected formats

#### User Experience
- Confusing button behavior
- Inconsistent visual feedback
- Poor responsive design on mobile devices

## üìù Bug Documentation

When you find a bug, document it thoroughly:

## üéØ Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

### **Beginning Level** (3-5 bugs found)
- Identify obvious visual and functional issues
- Use basic browser developer tools
- Follow systematic testing approaches
- Document bugs clearly

### **Intermediate Level** (6-10 bugs found)
- Demonstrate advanced debugging techniques
- Use developer tools effectively for investigation
- Identify subtle behavioral issues
- Understand root causes of problems

### **Advanced Level** (11+ bugs found)
- Find complex and hidden issues
- Show deep understanding of debugging methodology
- Help others with their debugging process
- Suggest improvements beyond just fixing bugs

## üí° Debugging Tips

### **Start Simple**
- Test the most obvious features first
- Don't assume anything works correctly
- Make one change at a time when testing

### **Be Systematic**
- Follow a consistent testing pattern
- Document everything you find
- Don't skip steps in your methodology

### **Use All Available Tools**
- Browser developer console
- Network inspection
- Element inspection
- JavaScript debugging features

### **Think Like a User**
- What would a normal user try to do?
- What might they do by accident?
- How might they misuse the calculator?

### **Look for Patterns**
- Do similar features have similar problems?
- Are there consistent types of errors?
- Do problems occur in specific areas of the code?

## üèÜ Challenge Extensions

### **For Fast Finishers**
1. Create comprehensive test cases for each bug you found
2. Prioritize the bugs by impact on user experience
3. Suggest improvements to prevent similar bugs in the future
4. Help other students with their debugging process

### **For Advanced Students**
1. Investigate the actual code to understand why each bug occurs
2. Propose specific code fixes (don't implement them yet!)
3. Consider edge cases that might reveal additional bugs
4. Design a testing strategy for the fixed version

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Open the Calculator**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` (buggy version)
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect"
3. **Start Testing**: Begin with basic arithmetic operations
4. **Document Findings**: Use the bug report template for each issue you discover
5. **Stay Systematic**: Don't jump around randomly - follow your methodology

Remember: The goal is not just to find bugs, but to develop systematic debugging skills that will serve you throughout your development career!
